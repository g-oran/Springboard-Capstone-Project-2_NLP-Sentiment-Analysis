# Springboard-Capstone-Project-2_NLP-Sentiment-Analysis
Natural Language Processing-Sentiment Analysis on Amazon Home and Kitchen Product Reviews

In this project, we tried to predict the rating scores based on the reviews left by the customers. It is explicitly shown that data set preparation and feature engineering are as much as important as the model creation. 

We applied; 
- Count Vector, TF-IDF, Hashing Vector, Word2Vec 
- Classification Models and Simple Neural Network 
- Adding most and least common words to CountVect, 
- SMOTE, 
- PCA + SMOTE 
- Truncated SVD + SMOTE
